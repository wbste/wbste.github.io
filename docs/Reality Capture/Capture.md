The later versions of the iPad Pro (and iPhone Pro for that matter) have a LiDAR sensor built in. I've tried [Scaniverse](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scaniverse-3d-scanner/id1541433223), [SiteScape](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sitescape-lidar-3d-scanner/id1524700432), [Polycam](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polycam-lidar-3d-scanner/id1532482376), [3d Scanner App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-app/id1419913995), and a few others.

The criteria for scanning software was:

- It must be process solely on the device. No sending data to the cloud for registration.
- It must be able to export, ideally both point cloud and mesh.
- It must be free, or very cheap if no free options were available. 

My personal favorite is **Scaniverse**. 100% free, exports to both point clouds and mesh file types, performs well, and has some basic crop functionality to cleanup scans. A close second is **SiteScape**, which limits how big a scan can be, but if you create a free account and log in, you can then export your scans and combine them manually in something like CloudCompare. **Seems to create the most dense/detailed point cloud of them all**. Specifically for mapping rooms with the goal of usable clean geometry, **Polycam** does an amazing job. It costs a few bucks for an export, but would be well worth it if that's the requirement.

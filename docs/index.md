This site will be for playing around and testing workflows, and maybe documenting things that a quick search didn't reveal. Thanks to [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), and [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/rs) for making this easy!
